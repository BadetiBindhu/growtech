                <p class="fs-md-4">The journey that impacted over 2 million lives started in 1996 when Dr. K. Anji Reddy, a renowned
                    scientist, entrepreneur and philanthropist, encouraged by the possibilities of helping others to
                    share and reap the benefits of India’s economic growth, started Dr.Reddy’s Foundation. The
                    foundation was established with a mission of assisting disadvantaged people to have access to
                    quality education and develop skills to keep pace with modern day challenges. After 25 years, the
                    mission has only grown to encompass some of the most complex social problems of the day but with the
                    same enthusiasm to change lives.</p>

                <p class="fs-md-4">DRF started in 1996 with the mission to educate and skill young people to fast track them towards
                    better livelihood options. Early programs focused on children’s education and skill development
                    among young people from lower income households. The foundation established a school and vocational
                    college to provide affordable quality education. Other education interventions include collaborating
                    to improve learning outcomes and infrastructure in under-resourced government schools and
                    establishment of an Education Resource Centre to meet the changing academic and pedagogical
                    requirements. On the skill development front our Livelihood Advancement Business School, better
                    known as LABS, was among the first short-term employment linked training programs in India.</p>

                <p>DRF focused on new frontiers like rural livelihoods, inclusion and healthcare to address more complex
                    social problems. But to address complex social problems on scale requires constant innovation and
                    collective cooperation. The foundation emphasized on testing innovative solutions that sustain over
                    necessary period and leveraging partnerships to scale up the impact. With several new strategies and
                    interventions, today we work in 20 states with diverse partners to collectively solve problems in
                    the areas of rural livelihoods, education, healthcare, skill Development, climate action and
                    inclusion. Our interventions are in line with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and stand
                    as an affirmation to our commitment to sustainably empower socially and economically disadvantaged
                    communities.
